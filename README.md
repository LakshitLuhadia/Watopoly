## Overview
In Watopoly, players take turns moving around the board, buying and improving on-campus buildings (which function as properties), and paying tuition (rent) to other players. The game features 40 squares, representing various locations on the University of Waterloo campus. The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining who has not gone bankrupt.
